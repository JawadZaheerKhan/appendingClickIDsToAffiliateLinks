# appendingClickIDsToAffiliateLinks

A client uses affiliate links to send traffic to a website. The link contains a query parameter 'kw' where the client can send useful info to get reports on.
Client wanted to track if traffic comes from bing ads or google ads then the kw report should reflect that so that client knows how his campaigns are doing, in terms of affiliate sales and profits
Client then also wanted me to send individual click IDs from google and bing so the kw should look like '?kw=minibus_bingads_msclkid=xyz' if the person comes from bing ad
Client would then use this click ID to upload offline conversions back to google and bing to see which campaigns, ads, keywords etc bring sales versus those that don't
